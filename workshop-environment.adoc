== First Step: Confirm Your Username!

Look in the box at the top of your screen. Is your username set already? If so it will look like this:

image::alreadyset.png[Set User ID above, 700]

If your username is properly set, then you can move on. **If not, in the above box, enter the user ID you were assigned** like this:

image::setuser.png[Set User ID above, 700]

This will customize the links and copy/paste code for this workshop. If you accidently type the wrong username, just click the green recycle icon to reset it.


== Click-to-Copy

You will see various code and command blocks throughout these exercises which can be copy/pasted directly by clicking anywhere on the block of text:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
/* A sample Java snippet that you can copy/paste by clicking */
public class CopyMeDirectly {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("You can copy this whole class with a click!");
    }
}
----

Simply click once and the whole block is copied to your clipboard, ready to be pasted with kbd:[CTRL+V] (or kbd:[Command+V] on Mac OS).

There are also Linux shell commands that can also be copied and pasted into a Terminal in your Development Environment:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
echo "This is a bash shell command that you can copy/paste by clicking"
----

== The Workshop Environment You Are Using

Your workshop environment consists of several components which have been pre-installed and are ready to use. Depending on which

that are your own and are isolated from other workshop students
* https://opendatahub.io[Open Data Hub] - A community-based distribution of Data Science tools.
* https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/amq[Red Hat AMQ Streams^] - streaming data platform
based on *Apache Kafka*
* Other open source projects like https://knative.dev[Knative^] (for serverless apps), https://jenkins.io/[Jenkins^] and https://cloud.google.com/tekton/[Tekton^] (CI/CD pipelines), https://prometheus.io[Prometheus^] and https://grafana.com[Grafana^] (monitoring apps), and more.
