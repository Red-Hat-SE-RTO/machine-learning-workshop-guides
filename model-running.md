== Running a Model in OpenShift.

Now that we have a trained model, we can go ahead and deploy our application and start feeding it data. If we have trained our model properly, we should get fairly accurate predictions about the data we are feeding it.

Run the app and see what happens...

Sometimes, the model does not end up being as accurate as we would like. This could be for a number of reasons. Today, the reason is that the size of the training set was insufficient. 

We will need to go back and retrain our model with a large set of data, which will give us an even more accurate model.
